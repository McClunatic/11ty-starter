# Overview

This site is meant to demonstrate how static site generation can make
documentation simpler and easier to develop and maintain! There are
several good static site generators to choose from. This site was
built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)

## What is Eleventy?

Eleventy is a static site generator implemented in JavaScript, but
don't let that fool you: it's **not a JavaScript framework**. That is
it generates no client-side JavaScript content. Instead, it works
with multiple template engines and languages to simplify HTML
content generation. Supported options include:

* HTML
* Markdown
* JavaScript
* Liquid
* Nunjucks
* Handlebars
* Mustache
* EJS
* Haml
* Pug
* Custom

Data can be injected into templates from a variety of places, using
both template "front matter"--data declarations as headings in
template files--and external data files.

## Advantages of Static Site Generators

Static site generators (SSGs) simplify the process of delivering
content to users. Advantages include:

1. Templating with prepared themes enables rapid devlopment and
   deployment of beautiful sites.
2. Relative to Single-Page Applications (SPAs), the HTML content
   is all pre-generated, making it friendlier for search engine
   optimizers.
3. Relative to full or headless Content Management Systems (CMSs),
   there is no requirement for heavier architectures to manage
   server loads and support server-side logic. Sites created
   by SSGs can be served entirely from Content Delivery Networks
   (CDNs) or other simple static site hosts.

## Other SSGs

Eleventy is one of many good options for static site generation. Some
of the bigger competitors are:

* Jekyll
* Hugo
* Gatsby
* Nuxt
* Next.js
